# Parse core function

The `parse()` core function is used to parse your schema and input data, and then run all the validations on your fields.

It's exported as a separate function which you can use, but it's also important to know that each schema provides a `parse()` function by itself - See the example below.

## Example

```ts showLineNumbers
import { parse } from '@nordic-ui/validathor';

const mySchema = object({ ... });

parse(mySchema, { ... });
// Or
mySchema.parse({ ... });
```
